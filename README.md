# ESPHome-SML-Hichi-IR
ESPHome configuration example to read Power Meter via IR TTL (Hichi EHZ Volksz√§hler)

I'm using an ESP8266 NodeMCU and the Hichi IR TTL reader connected to GPIO3 (RX)

This configuration works for me with my Iskra (Iskraemeco) MT631

If needed change your obis_code accordingly to your Power Meters provided values.


To see which obis_code's are sent from your power meter, you can simply set the log level for sml to DEBUG.
